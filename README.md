# VideoStore Application

## Purpose
The `VideoStore` application simulates a simple video rental system where users can manage a collection of videos. It allows users to add videos, check them out, return them, rate them, and view the inventory of available videos. This project serves as a practical example of object-oriented programming principles in Java.

## Features
- **Add Videos**: Users can add new videos to the store by providing the video name.
- **Check Out Videos**: Users can check out a video if it's available, marking it as checked out.
- **Return Videos**: Users can return a video they previously checked out, marking it as available again.
- **Receive Ratings**: Users can provide a rating (1-5) for any video in the store.
- **List Inventory**: Users can view the entire inventory of videos along with their ratings and checkout status.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A console-based menu provides an interactive way for users to perform operations.

## How to Run
### Prerequisites
- Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine (version 8 or higher).
- An IDE (like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans) or a text editor (like Visual Studio Code) for editing the code.

Steps to Run
Clone the Repository: Open your terminal and run:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/videostore.git
cd videostore
Compile the Code: In the terminal, navigate to the project directory and compile the Java files:

bash
Copy code
javac Pr/VideoLauncher.java
Run the Application: Execute the compiled Java program:

bash
Copy code
java Pr.VideoLauncher
